I started this project because I thought that trying to design a game from scratch
would be the best way to properly learn how to engineer software over the course of
my life. It would give me great insight to my weaknesses and how I overcame them,
and how I have molded my mental framework of coding over time, to give me a better
visualisation of how I comprehend code, and some practices that should be implemented
which I would learn along the way. I suppose you could say this is my practical journal.
